    <!-- Cropes Description -->
    <string name="bjri">Blocks of earlier crops, garnished with stalks, should clean the soil.Prior to the dynasty, mix 2.5 to 3 tons (5 to 6 bullock pumps) in the field of compost or compost, and in the second frost it should be mixed well in the soil.
        \n\n<b>Sowing:</b> After sowing of summer season of bajra, it is worthwhile in the second fortnight of January to fall in the first fortnight of February.
        If the temperature drops below 10 degrees Celsius, then it is susceptible to damage. If the duration of the sowing is delayed, then the crop comes in flowering after 50 to 55 days of age. If the temperature is higher than 42 degrees C and pollen is likely to die and the production is likely to decrease. Also, late harvesting of the kharif season is delayed due to the delay in summer harvesting.
        \n\n<b>Seed treatment:</b> Use of certified seeds of 1.2 to 1.6 kg per acre. If seeded processed seed is not available, seed should be processed with 20% salt solution (2 kg of salt in 10 liters of water) before sowing for seed disease. Release the seeds of millet in this solution. Drain the fungalized light seeds on the water. Separately, the seeds remaining under the bottom and heavy weight should be washed 2 to 3 times and then dry them in the shade.
        For preventing the prevention of Gosavi disease, seed treatment should be processed in this quantity of seeds in the shade of Metallaxil (35 sd) 6 gm. After chemical processing, the seeds should be processed with zospirillium and phosphorus bacteria for 25 g / kg of each. By 20% savings of nitrogen and phosphorus, 10% increase in production due to the bacterial conservation process. Gravity is uniform and the initial growth of PK is good
        \n\n<b>Sowing:</b> After sowing, after sowing, after sowing, sowing should be done. The distance between the two lines is 30 cm And the difference between two plants is 15 cm Keep it Prepare a flat vapor for 5 to 7 meters long and 3 to 4 meter wide, depending on the land slope. Do it by two wheels, ie fertilizers and seeds can be sown at the same time. Sowing 2 to 3 cm Do not do it at more than the room.
        \n\n<b>Fertilizer Management:</b> At the time of sowing, give 18 kg of nitrogen (39 kg urea), 18 kg of phosphorus (112 kg single super phosphate) and 18 kg potash (30 kg of mutant of potash) per acre. Similarly, after 25 to 30 days after sowing, the second installment should be given to 18 kg of nitrogen (39 kg urea).
        \n\n<b>Cropping:</b> To maintain the correct number of single seedlings, the first rinse should be done after 10 days of sowing and after second sowing, 20 days after sowing, the difference between two plants is 15cm. Keep it 48,000 seedlings per acre are live
        \n\n<b>Inter-school:</b> It is necessary to keep the weeds free from the beginning of 30 days of sowing, because there is competition for getting air, water, nutrients and sunlight between weeds and crops during this period. It is weeding twice and two times according to need. If there is a shortage of labor, then 400 gm of acid per hectare mixed in 200 liters of water per acre, but after sowing, it should be sprayed on ground before planting and weeding in 25-30 days after sowing.
        \n\n<b>Water Management:</b> After 3 to 4 days after sowing, lightly give the first water (mango). After this, according to the condition of the land, in the sensitive condition of the crop, it should be given 5 to 6 water shifts at intervals of 10 to 12 days. If the availability of water is limited, the first stage should be given at the time of arrival of water (20 to 25 days after sowing), second water in the crop area (35 to 45 days after sowing) and third feeding of the grains (60 to 65 days after sowing)
        \n\n<b>Harvesting and production:</b> In the initial phase of crop during the summer season, the growth of the crop is slow due to the low gravity of the sprouting. Therefore it takes more time for the growth of the crop, so summer harvesting season is late 10-15 days after the bajra. The use of summer biscuits hybrid or improved varieties, proper balance sheet and water management, yields up to 14 to 16 quintals per acre. It also provides fodder for milch animals and other animals.\n

    <string name="jawari"><b>How to choose varieties of sorghum?</b>\n
        Kharif season is a rainy season. Often, the crop rains when the crop is matured. It affects the crop. As a result, sorghum grows in the jowar and the jowar becomes black. Income also decreases in yield due to increasing production. For this, the varieties used for the Parbhani Shivalata (PVK 801) and Twin Useful Plant PVK 809 for Vardharao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, Parbhani are used for cultivation.
        Sowing period For the second week of June and the first week of July, it is the perfect period for jawar cultivation. If the duration of the lengthening is delayed then the incidence of cholera increases.Proof of seed
        Hectare 7.5 kg for hybrid sorghum and 10 kg seed of hectare for improved air use.
        \n\n<b>Seed Procedure:</b>\nSeed treatment of Azotobacter bacteria enhancer, nitrogen and phosphorous lymph bacteria, 250 gm per 8-10 kg seed.
        "If delayed planting, prevention of incidence of throat disease, thymathoxemm (70%) should process seed according to 3g / kg Manure Management"
        "Hectury should be well mixed in 5 tons of manure soil. Kharif sorghum is recommended for 80 kg of nitrogen, 40 kg of phosphorus and 40 kg potash per head. Of these, you should give half the nitrogen, complete phosphorus and full potash while sowing. Most likely, the first quantity should be mixed or mixed (150 kg 10-26-26 grams and 50 kg urea). The remaining half-nitrates should be given at 85 kg urea after 30 to 35 days after sowing. Fertilizers should be 5 cm below the seed during sowing. Give it"
        \n\n<b>Inter-school:</b>\nIt is 8-10 days after sowing, it should be filled. 20 cm in 15 days At the distance there is a rape like 1 rope. To handle weeds, weeding twice and two times till crop 40-45 days.
        \n\n<b>Peak protection:</b>\nTo control the debris, spraying of syrupmethrin (10% fluid) in 20 ml per 10 liters of water and after 14 days of sowing, it should be sprayed.

    <string name="corn"><b>Introduction:</b>
        Rabbi season is the winter â€¦ How to make rabbit maize rabbit during this winter season? It is necessary to know this. For rabi corn crops, it is necessary to select medium-to-heavy fertile, well-drained land. The soil in which the organic content is high is suitable for cultivation of land. Generally, the land mass should be between 6.5 to 7.5. Maize crops are also grown in diverse weather conditions.Therefore, corn may be planted at a height of 2700 meters above sea level, but fog may be more prone to corn crops.
        \n\n<b>What is the right temperature for maize?</b>
During rabi season there is an increase in the temperature, so there is a decrease in temperature. But, for the corn crop, the average 18 to 20 degrees. Temperatures can be fruitful.
During the Rabi season the temperature of the night is mild and decreases the decrease in the amount of light decreased due to light, respiratory failure.
Also, the process of photosynthesis becomes faster and faster due to the length, width, structure of the leaf and the intense sunlight for 7-8 hours, which increases the product by increasing the duration of the crop.
\n\n<b>How Important Is Water Management?</b>
Rabi season can be said to be less humid because the dew falls on the night due to cold.
Due to mild temperatures and low humidity in the rabi season, the incidence of diseases and pests is very less.
In the rabi season the plant number can be kept in the proper quantity due to land and water management, as well as lower incidence of diseases and pests.
If the weeds get proper control, the effectiveness of the chemical fertilizers used will increase.
\n\n<b>How to sow?</b>
In rabi season, sowing of maize under 60 cm in the bag, at half the height of half an inch, in between 18 to 20 cm, two seeds four to five cm. Do it by biting deep.
If the sowing is done on the south side of the sari, the sunlight germination becomes better and the growth of the crops is strong.
If it is planned in the sowing, it will get about 90,000 seedlings per hectare and result in higher yields.
\n\n<b>What care should be taken to control disease?
</b>
Before sowing, two to two and a half grams of thyroid juice is controlled by fungicide per kg of seeds.
Also, if the Azotobacter bacterial breeding grows 15 grams per kilogram of seeds, then there will be five percent increase in production.
\n\n<b>How to use fertilizers?</b>

Chemical fertilization is used during sowing.
At the time of sowing, the chemical fertilizers should be mixed in 5 to 7 cm area and soil well.
Once the harvest is successful, then in the vertical peak, the nitrogen fertilizer (urea) is 10-12 cm. Give it away from the line and give it water immediately.
Water should be given at an interval of 10 to 12 days according to the condition of the soil.
After plucking maize after ten days, keep a single vigorous rope on a four foot

    <string name="wheat"><b>The technique is the cultivation of wheat
</b>Presently the work of farmers is going on for rabbis everywhere. The main crop of rabi season is wheat. Wheat production is widely grown in Punjab in India. The rabbi season is the season of cold weather, it should not be a waste. The wheat crop provides cool and dry weather. The higher the chill and the more they survive, the better the growth of the wheat crop. If wheat crop gets more than 100 days in cold weather, production can get more and better qualitThat is why cold weather is necessary for wheat crop.
\n\n<b>Planting:-</b>
There are some rules in the agricultural field to take any crop. Therefore, the season of each crop is fixed. The farming land and the method of harvesting crops that play a major role in this. In the case of wheat, wheat is cultivated in both the cultivation and in the garden. In this case, if considered for horticulture, then it is necessary to have good drainage ground. Such a land in which the moisture can survive for long periods of time. Therefore, select the best quality land for the cultivation.
\n\n<b>Pre-Educative:-</b>
Proper and adequate cultivation is necessary for the wheat crop to grow well. Because, the root of the wheat crop is 60 to 75 cm. Because of the fact that a good crop of land is going to be harvested, good farm work is needed. Therefore, after harvesting the kharif season and iron-plow with 15-20 cm. Planting deep land should be given and after 3 to 4 times the diversification should be given. In this way cultivation can be done to clean the land from the earlier crop dust and weeds.
If it is well planted during Kharipa, it can be beneficial to fry the land by three to four shifts of clay.
\n\n<b>Sowing:-</b>
October is very good for wheat sowing. Sowing should be done in the second fortnight of October. However, if the sowing of horticultural wheat is to be sown, the correct time is the first fortnight of November. During this period, the yield of wheat is better if sowing is done. Horticultural wheat can be sown late, but the result is on the production.
\n\n<b>What is the number of seedlings?</b>\n
If you want more product then it is important how much plant you plant in the soil. Therefore, the number of seedlings is important. If there is a total number of seedlings in the field of about 20 to 22 lakhs per hectare, the product can get better. For this, use 100 to 125 kg of seed per hectare. For late sowing, use 125-150 kg seed per hectare. Seedlings of 75 to 100 kg of hectare for cumin seed should be used for sowing.
\n\n<b>How to plan for fertilizer?</b>
There is a need for food grains for horticultural and dry-wheat wheat. Hence, chemical fertilizer planning is important. For timely sowing 50:50:50 kg nitrogen, phosphorus, potash per hectare and 50 kg of nitrogen should be given 21 days after sowing. For late sowing should be given 40:40:40 kg nitrogen, potash per hectare.
In this way, if wheat is sown by proper planning, good and quality product can be obtained. As a result, the farmers need the information before harves

    <string name="tomato"><b>Introduction:</b>
        \nIn Maharashtra, there are approximately 29,190 hectare area under tomato cultivation. Nashik, Pune, Satara, Ahmednagar, Nagpur, Sangli are important districts of Maharashtra producing tomato. Tomatoes are the main fruit of the farmers of Maharashtra, as the three varieties are cultivated in tomato crop in Kharif and Rabi summer season. Since tomato is widely available in the head protector food, then the importance of diet of tomatoes is unique. Tomato A, B and C vitamins and mineral nutrients like lime, iron etc are also adequate in tomatoes.Raw or reddish-white fruits of tomatoes are used for vegetable or salad. It can also be made from tomatoes-frozen fruits like soup, pickle, sauce, ketchup, jam, juice etc. This has led to the increased industrial importance of tomatoes.
        \n\n<b>Weather:</b>
        \nAlthough tomato is a hot weather crop, tomato is cultivated throughout the year in Maharashtra. If there is excessive cold, tomato tree growth Fluctuations in temperature fluctuate effect. The plant growth was good in temperature ranging from 13 to 38 Celsius. Flowers and fruits are good. If the temperature of the night is between 18 to 20 Celsius, then the fruit of tomato is good. The liquepopne hectare, which gives attractive color to the fruits, pigment is widely prepared at temperatures ranging from 26 to 32 cents. The combined results of temperature, sunlight and humidity are on the growth of the crop. Tomato Crop yields a good yield as compared to 20 to 32 degrees Celsius, 11 to 12 hours of clean sunshine and 60 to 75 percent of the humidity.
        \n\n<b>Land:</b>
        \nMedium to heavy plantation is suitable for tomato crop. Fruits in light soil get ready early, water drains get better And the growth of the crops was good. But in such a land, organic fertilizers have to be filled up and there is a need for frequent watering. The medium content of the soil should be 6 to 8.
        \n\n<b>Predetermined:</b>
        \nAfter giving the plowing of the fields, plowing should be broken and wrapped. For the cultivation of 30-40 units of hectare in the soil, the spacing between the two lines should be 60 to 90cm and the difference between the two plants should be 45 to 60cm. For the Kharif and winter season, cultivate at 90 x 60 cm distance and 60 to 45 cm distance for the summer season.
        \n\n<b>Season:</b>
        \nKharif - in June, J. B. Peraway.
        Rabbi (winter season) September, in the month of October sow seed.
        Summer season - in December, January will be sown
        The proportion of seeds is 400 to 500 gm of hectare tomato crop.
        \n\n<b>Improved varieties:</b>
        \nThe varieties of tomato varieties suitable for cultivation in Maharashtra are as follows.
        \nPusa Ruby: It can be taken in three seasons. After the cultivation, fruits can be harvested from 45 to 90 days after planting. Fruit furrows are shaped like red sand. Hectare production 325 quintals
        \nPusa Gaurav: This caste shrub is growing fast. The fruits become yellowish crimson after lubrication. The traffic is right. Hectare yield 400 quintals
        \nPusa Shital: Planting is suitable for the winter season, and the fruits are rounded red in color. Hectare yield 350 quintals
        \nArka Gaurav: The fruit is dark red fleshy and comfortable. Hectare production up to 350 quintals
        \nRoma: The trees are small and shrubbery and it is suitable for transport because it is long and thick in size. Hectare production is 25 tons.Rupali, Vaishali, Bhagyashree, Arka Vikas, Pusa Early Dwarf etc. Caste is cultivated.
        \n\n<b>Planting:</b>
        \nSeeds should be sown on the bed. Before preparing the bed plant, make sure to double the soil by placing it 2, 3. Gadai wafa is 1m The width should be 3m long and 15cm high. Grind 1 gram Fenugreek, add 50 grams of soyafa and make the steam flat with the hand. Before sowing, wash 3 gm of thyroid fungicide. Planting of seeds should be planted with parallel fingers by cutting the waist and covering it with soil. Water should be provided to the flyer. After germination of seed, after 10 to 12 days, give two grams of poultry in two rows and give 10 gm for each leaflet. Keep the steam in the weasel. To control the flowering and crushing disease, after splitting 15 days after seedling, sprinkle 12-20 ml of monocrotocus and 25 gm of dyhenene M-45 in 10 liters of water. The next two sprays should be done at intervals of 10 days. After 25 to 30 days of sowing, it is generally after seedlings are raised to 12 to 15 cm then the seedlings should be restored to the entire world. Give water to the vapor a day before planting the seedlings. Therefore, the seedlings of seedlings are easily accessible without roots. Planting of plants should always be done in the evening or after the reduction.
        \n\n<b>Chemical fertilizers:</b>
        \n200-100-100 for the right varieties and 300-150-150 kg of nitrogen, phosphoric powder for hybrid varieties. Half of the nitrogen should be given at the time of cultivation and 40 days after planting.
        \n\n<b>Water management:</b>
        \nProvide light water for 3 to 4 days after planting. And then after 8 to 10 days, give another water. In the rainy season, tomato crop should be given at intervals of 8 to 10 days during the monsoon season, and during winter season 5 to 7 days intervals and summer season should be given to the plants for 3 to 4 days intervals. Always give light water to heavy black soil. Regular water supply is important when the crop is blooming and fruit growth. Otherwise the fluffy, frying of fruit, is likely to dissipate like this. In the summer, if it gives a traditional method of watering tomatoes, it needs 77 hectare of water. If water is given by drip irrigation, it needs 56 hectare of water. Due to drip irrigation, water yields 50 to 55 percent and yields 40 percent increase.
        \n\n<b>Inter-school:</b>
        \nRemove weeds by regular weeding. Take care that weeds do not hurt the root cause. So that it can have adverse effects on the yield.
        \n\n<b>Turn and garden support:</b>
        \nThe tomato crop is weak and they are weak because they need support. By supporting, the growth of the trees and the branches was good. The fruit takes a lot. Fruits, leaves and branches are not exposed to land or water. This reduces the number of fruit rot and disease. Fertilizer, spraying, etc. Work can be done easily. Tomato trees can be supported in two ways. 1. Each plant should be made to stick a stick of one to two meters long and stick a stick with a sticky stick. 2. In this case, the tart is made using a star and bamboo or sticks. And trees are grown on the basis of these tapes. Take the rate of every 10 feet in front of the saree and apply it to the height of two meters in height and with a thick semi-thickness, it should be raised in both directions. Bundle with a stellar string in front of each stem and tie it with stringed instruments. After that, build a gauge of 45 gm from the ground and sew each stitch by siege and stretch it to the other end, thus the second 90 cm and the third at 120 cm distance. These branches should be made of twine or nylon ropes. To make a tomato cage, it is necessary to turn the tree around.
        \n\n<b>Disease and kidney disease:</b>
        \nDisease Karpa: This disease can occur in any condition of tree growth. The leaves in the disease fall on the stalks and brown spots on it.
        \nRemedies: Spread the dyhemum M45, 25 liters in 10 liters of water, and mix it well. Spraying should be done at intervals of 10-15 days.

    <string name="orange"><b>Introduction:</b>
The Nagpur Saratra of Sandra in Maharashtra is famous for its amazing taste. Concentrates are cultivated mainly in Vidarbha. Farmers of western Maharashtra and Marathwada also have the opportunity to cultivate orangery.

\n\n<b>Weather:</b>
Increase the orange tree from 13 to 37 degrees. Gray This is excellent in the temperature range. Heat and slightly humid weather, this crop yields 370m I Plant growth is good for 50 to 53 percent air humidity
\n\n<b>Land:</b>
Moderate black soil of 1 to 1.5 m, under which soil moist soil or a few limestone or sand-mixed soil, and the acidic index of the soil ranges from 5.5 to 7.5. Plant cultivation of such lands is best understood. Heavy black lands, in which black soil is 1.5 to 3.5 meters deep and there is a layer of sticking soil. Because of the ability to hold water in such a large quantity of water, the trees are dried after due to excessive amount of water. Therefore, do not plant orange plant in such a type of soil.
\n\n<b>Predetermined:</b>
After planting the orange garden, after the selection of the land, make the soil deep. Narmamatha, Harali, Kas and Kunda should be taken from the roots. The land should be fried by keeping the clay. If there is fluctuation, then bring the land to the level of equilibrium.
\n\n<b>Selection of Colors:</b>
Organic plantation is done through artificial cloths. While selecting the pen, it should be filled with eyes full of scientifically healthy, kind, vigorous, growing, zamble, or colorful lemon. Treatment of oranges should be taken from agriculture universities and government nurses.
\n\n<b>Castes:</b>
Orange orangra orangra, orange orange and no. There are 182 species of these species.
\n\n<b>Preparation for cultivation:</b>

    <string name="apple">
    There are more than 8,000 different varieties of apples. Most are bred for their taste and utilitarian use, including cooking and cider production.
\n Apple trees are generally produced by grafting (attaching a piece of an existing tree to a root stock to form a new tree) or from seeds.
One benefit of grafted trees is they will bear fruit much more quickly than those grown from seed- with grafted trees, you can even get a tree that bears fruit the first year.
        \n\n <b>Some popular varieties of apple trees include:</b>
\n Honeycrisp Apple Trees
\n Fuji Apple Trees
\n Gala Apple Trees
\n Red Delicious Apple Trees
\n Granny Smith Apple Trees
\n Pink Lady Apple Trees
\n Golden Delicious Apple Trees
\n McIntosh Apple Trees
\n\n <b>What types of apple trees should you plant?</b>
\n Ideally, your apple orchard (no matter how big or small it is) will be in production for many years. In order to protect your investment and bear fruit, itâ€™s important to choose the right apple trees to suit your needs and climate.
\n\n <b>How do you select the right apple trees for your garden? </b>
        \n It depends on a few different things, including your climate and hardiness zone, landscape, how many apple trees you want to plant and which varieties.
        \n Below are a few considerations:
\n\n <b>Apple trees for different climates</b>
\n <b>Want to plant apple trees in a colder climate? </b>
         \n You will want to find apple tree varieties well-suited to Northern areas.
        \n In a warmer climate? Check out apple trees that are best for Southern.
        \nIf you are on the West Coast, you will want to choose from Western apple trees.
        \nMost apples fall within two or more different groups, so it is easy to find the right apple tree as well as a companion pollinator that will thrive in the same climate.
\n <b>Apple tree sizes</b>
\n Apple trees come in many different sizes, from full-size trees to dwarf trees that grow 8-10 feet tall. You will want to evaluate the size of your planting area to determine what apple variety is best - and remember, in most cases, you will want to leave room for at least two apple trees, if not more.
\n\n <b>How big do you want your apple trees to get? </b> \n Keep in mind that apple trees contain three parts: the branches, the trunk, and the root system.
\n Our dwarf apple trees are grafted for a more controlled size. Most dwarf trees maintain heights of between 10 to 15 feet, which make them easier for fitting into small landscapes and easily picking fruit.
\n <b>Working with an even smaller area? </b>
        \n Consider a new variety like columnar apple trees - designed to grow upright without horizontal branching, they are perfect for small spaces and even patios or balconies.
\n <b>Apple tree flavor</b>
\n Think about your favorite flavors and what you like to taste in apples - do you like sweeter apples, or more tart? Once you figure out what type of apples you like, think about how you plan to use your apples. Are you planning on snacking, baking, juicing or canning? Dessert apples are best for eating fresh, whereas culinary apples are best for cooking. Some apples have to be eaten within a few days of being picked, while others can be stored for a month or more before eating â€“ and can actually improve in flavor over time. For example, Red Delicious Apples are one of the sweetest cultivars available.
\n Youyou willll also need to consider how many trees you need to plant. If you want to grow several trees, that can affect the specific types of trees you purchase. Different varieties can ripen at different times, from late summer to late fall, and different varieties are required to pollinate specific apple trees.
\n <b>Where should apple trees be planted?</b>
\n Most apple trees grow best in a warm climate with full sunlight  and good air circulation. The best spot is typically on the north side of a house or treeline.
\n Apple trees need well-draining soil, and light- to medium-textured soils work best - apple trees typically do not thrive in heavy clay soil. Avoid any areas where cold might settle in lower areas, and avoid planting near wooded areas or other trees that might block sun.
\n <b>If you are planting an apple tree in a Northern state:</b>
\n It is best to choose early to mid-season varieties that will ripen in an area with a shorter growing season.
\n <b>If you are planting an apple tree in a Southern state:</b>
\n We recommend finding a sheltered space facing the Southern part of your garden. Planting the trees near a hedge or wall can help protect the trees from wind damage.
\n <b>When should apple trees be planted?</b>

\n Apple trees are very hardy. They can withstand most conditions, including extreme cold and wind. It is typically best to plant your apple trees during the spring - however, if you live in an area with mild autumns and your winter months have moisture in the air, they can be planted in the fall. In that case, ensure you plant six weeks prior to first frost so the tree can establish properly before winter.
\n <b>Apple tree diseases</b>
\n While apple trees are very hard, there are a few diseases that may affect apple trees. The best defense is a healthy tree. Maintaining proper soil conditions, adequate water levels, and fertilization can help your trees thrive.
\n <b>Here are a few diseases to avoid:</b>
\n <b>Fire blight</b>
\n Fire blight is a bacterial disease that causes branches to blacken, giving them a scorched look, and will kill the tree eventually. You can control this blight by either choosing trees that are genetically resistant to the disease, or removing blighted branches off the tree.
\n <b>Powdery mildew</b>
\n Powdery mildew attacks the foliage and fruit on apple trees. It is a white fungus that will appear on the leaves, fruit, and flowers. If left untreated, it will eventually cause the treeâ€™s health to decline. You can help control this disease by applying a fungicide to the tree during early spring, just as the leaves are starting to push out.
\n <b>Apple scab</b>

        \n An apple scab is a fungus that leaves black soot-like spots on the leaves and fruit. This disease mostly affects new leaves in the spring, during moist conditions. However, it can affect mature leaves during May and early June.
\n The fungus appears as black velvety spots on the leaves. As a result, the leaves turn yellow and eventually drop.You can control this disease by either choosing disease-resistant apples, or applying fungicides as the leaves come out during the spring.
\n <b>Cedar apple rust</b>
\n Cedar apple rust is a fungus that leaves rusty spots on the leaves of the tree. This disease commonly affects Juniper, Cedar, and Apple Trees. When this fungus attacks Apple Trees, the leaves will develop small yellow spots in late spring. As the tree becomes more stressed, both leaves and fruit will drop off the tree prematurely. Cedar Apple Rust cannot be controlled once the tree is infected.
\n <b>Apple tree care and planting tips</b>
\n <b>What is the best soil for apple trees?</b>
\n Apple trees can tolerate a wide range of soil types, but they prefer well-drained soil with high acidity. We recommend planting them in rich soil. Your apple tree will benefit most from being fertilized yearly with a 10-10-10 formula. Fertilizer is especially helpful if you notice that the treeâ€™s leaves are pale in color, or that the tree has grown less than inches per year.
\n <b>How much should you water your apple trees?</b>
\n Apples trees are hearty trees that do not require much care when they are first planted, and they often thrive without much water once they become established. However, if you live in a dry area or experience a prolonged period of drought, we recommend 4 to 6 inches of water every couple of weeks. Apple trees thrive best in full sun, for at least 6 to 8 hours per day.
\n <b>How to protect your apple tree</b>

        \n <b>There are a few preventative steps you can take to maintain your treeâ€™s health:</b>
\n <b>Apply a fungicide spray on growing trees</b>
\n This will help reduce the likelihood of infection spreading from surrounding junipers, cedars and apple trees.
\n <b>Remove dead, damaged, or diseased branches</b>
\n This includes suckers - the shoots that come up from the roots or base of your tree. You can also treat your trees with insecticide to help prevent these diseases from occurring.
\n <b> Why is my apple tree not producing fruit?</b>
\n Apple trees can have good and bad years. This is another good reason to have more than one tree, even if your tree is self-fertile. At times, a tree may have very few blossoms, even when the spring weather is good. This can often be caused by incorrect pruning during the previous summer. The tree may also have trouble bearing fruit due to prolonged stress from lack of water or nutrients. Giving your tree adequate water and fertilizer will help prevent this issue.

    <string name="greps"><b>Introduction:</b>
        There is a mention in the Bible about the production of a Nova granulated vineyard . Plena (E. 23-79), the Roman scientist has described 91 types of grape varieties, there are several types of alcoholic beverages and 50 varieties of grape varieties.
        \n\n<b>Area of cultivation</b>
        Grape production is more than any other fruit in the global production of fruits. In the world of 1972 9 8 odds. The area was under the grape. 80% of the product is used for making liquor, 13% for eating and 7% for raisins and currant preparation. France, Italy, Spain, Turkey and Russia are the major grappling countries. The United States of America, Algeria, Romania, Argentina, Greece and Portugal are the other countries. Iran, Afghanistan, D. Even in Africa and Australia, it is cultivated for a very large number of trees. In India, it was in 967-68. 8,000 people were in this area and they were in the world.
        \n\n<b>Land and climate:</b>
        Good drift, light or medium black or 60-90 cm The land, which is deep and underneath, is very suitable for planting. The water drain is very important in this crop. The subtropical region is favorable for grape cultivation. Long-term, hot, dry-dry (non-rain) summer season is essential for this crop. Rainfall in just 3-4 months a year, 3,000 m in the periods of hot and dry climate.
        \n\n<b>Planting:</b>
        There are two methods for planting grapes. After preparing the same brush papers, they get straight into the field in the month of October. At one place, the two small pen should be 10-15 cm. Get interrupted. She roses vine 30-45 cm Upon increasing, after placing one section of them vigorously, one is removed. The second method is 30X15 cm in October. The cuttings applied at the distance from two to two and a half months after the flowering of the vine begins to grow, in their regular place in January. At that time, the vine can be taken carefully by the boards of the soil of the soil. Now fill the soil in plastic bags and fill the clogs in it. And they can be put to a permanent place after they are destroyed. Get rid of the vine lines south-east.
        \n\n<b>Fertilizer:</b>
        Because of the abundance of the crop every year, the vineyards absorb very large amount of nutrients from the soil. To compensate them, it is necessary to give fertilizers and fertilizers to the farmers. April and October, after pruncation, lots of quantities given after the April pruning. The method of turnaround, type of vine, fruit capacity and the type of soil have been taken into account in terms of these factors, and according to fertilizer, it has been decidedly as fertilizer.
        \n\n<b>Disease:</b>
        Grapes are bury, kayvada and karpa, which are important fungal diseases (there are chronic diseases like chlorofluorant).
        \n\n<b>Generate:</b>
        Grape variety depends on the type of grape variety, rich nutrients, proper weather, systematic planting, turning on the basis, pruning and cultivation, protection of diseases from diseases and pests. Income reduces in first year But they grow from next year. Generally, 10-15 ton grapes are obtained in Maharashtra. The average yield of grape in India is more than 10 tons of hectare, and is much higher than Californias income and more than the major countries in the world of grappling plants like France, Italy and Spain.

    <string name="papaya">\n\n<b>Introduction:</b>
    \nPapaya is a continuous green leafy fruit tree. They were brought to the 16th century in India. Now it was planted in the Hawaii Islands, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Malaysia, Australasia, the Philippines Islands and India. The dry and rainy weather of India and 1,300m from the sea. Papaya can grow in the area of high altitude. As per available information, the total area of papaya cultivation in India is 10,848 ha. And the maximum area (3,880 ha.) Is in the state of Bihar. Assam has 2,041 ha., Madhya Pradesh has 2,000 hectares. And Maharashtra and Gujarat together 1,236 Area and 1,417 in otherstates. Is the area.
    \n\n<b>Weather:</b>
    \nPapaya growth is good in dry dry weather and proper water supply. 2Â°C PAPI does not believe in the temperature below. The fruits produced in cold weather are tasteless.
    \n\n<b>Land:</b>
    \nPaddy cultivation is good, free of water well, and plenty of bio-food supply. Paddy in the middle black soil of the southern part of India, as well as in the field of sand, increases the papaya. The lack of rustic limestone and lack of biomass and good black and white soil is not good. In the case of this crop, water drainage is very important. If the drainage is not properly done, then the stomach rust causes irritation.
    \n\n<b>Planting:</b>
    \nSeedlings are planted and planted. Planting of plowing, ditching, dredging, etc., in the early rainy season and rainy season in monsoon in less rainy areas.
    \n\n<b>Preparation of seedlings:</b>
    \nGood people take a full seed of fruit seed bearing fruit, and they are washed and cleaned and stored in a shade by drying it. Fresh seeds are always good for seedlings. Before the planting season Seed two weeks for the plants. 250 gms of seedlings to be planted in one hectare area B is enough. B. Generally, they are installed in the bedroom. Seedlings 9 - 12 cm After the height, they can be removed from the stomach and kept in a permanent place in the prepared area. Two pits of 2-3 m We keep planting plants by keeping distance. There is no difference between male and female in plantation conditions. There are 40-60 tectonic plants grown in the planted plants. The rest are narzed. The yield in a particular area is reduced because the stalk does not produce fruits. To avoid this, you can put two or three seedlings in one or two slopes. If the seedlings grow and they flower, then the difference between male and female can be identified. After placing two or four pods in the entire garden, the remaining chana trees are cut off. Therefore, there is more than average female seedlings in the cultivation.

    <!-- Soils Description -->
    <string name="loam">
        \n<b>Loam</b> â€” This type of soil helps grow the best possible crops because it provides the necessary elements. Loamy sand contains mostly sand plus clay and silt. It is good for root vegetables, such as carrots and beets, leafy vegetables, and tomatoes.
    </string>
    <string name="clay">
        \n<b>Clay</b> â€” Cabbage and broccoli grow well in clay soil, but it may not be good for root vegetables because of its dense texture, writes D. Laverne Oâ€™Neal in Hunker. Cherry, pear, maple, and black walnut trees also thrive in clay soil. Edible herbs, including yarrow and red valerian, also benefit from it.
    </string>
    <string name="sand">
      \n<b>Sand</b> â€” Root vegetables, including turnips, parsnips, and carrots, grow well in sandy soil as do pomegranate and fig trees. Bush clover, bayberry, creeping juniper, and thyme are among the herbs that do well in sandy soil.
        \n\n<b>Soil texture:</b>Quartz is the predominant mineral in the sand fraction of most soils. Sand particles have a relatively small surface area per unit weight, low water retention and little chemical activity compared with silt and clay.
    </string>
    <string name="silt">
        \n<b>Silt</b> â€” Silty soil is fertile and offers nutrients for development. Lettuce, cabbage, carrots, turnips, and many other vegetables flourish in silt. Strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, citrus trees, and pomegranate trees also develop well in silt.
        \n\n<b>Soil texture</b>Silt has a relatively limited surface area and little chemical activity. Soils high in silt may compact under heavy traffic and this affects the movement of air and water in the soil.
    </string>
    <string name="peat">
        \n<b>Peat</b> â€” Peaty soil provides growth when mixed with rich organic matter, lime, and compost that reduces its acidity, according to Eartheasy. Legumes, root crops, cabbage, and spinach are easily grown in soil thatâ€™s well-drained.
     </string>
    <string name="chalk">
        \n<b>Chalk</b> â€” Sweet corn, beets, spinach, and cabbage are among the vegetables that benefit from more chalky soil. It is recommended that farmers use fertilizers and balance the pH levels to deal with the alkaline that can sometimes stunt growth.
    \n\n<b>Soil texture</b>Clays have very large surface areas compared with the other inorganic fractions. As a result clays are chemically very active and are able to hold nutrients on their surfaces. These nutrients can be released into soil water from where they can be used by plants. Like nutrients, water also attaches to the surfaces of clays but this water can be hard for plants to use.
    There are many different types of clays. The ability of clays to swell and to retain a shape into which they have been formed, as well as their sticky nature, distinguish them from sand and silt.
